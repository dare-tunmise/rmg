                            In a small coastal town where secrets wash ashore with the tide, Eleanor Harrison returns after twenty years to confront the mysteries of her past. When strange echoes begin to haunt the cliffside mansion she inherited, Eleanor discovers her family's connection to an ancient legend that may hold the key to present-day disappearances. As she delves deeper, the line between reality and myth begins to blur, forcing her to question everything she thought she knew about her identity.

                            When Dr. Amara Chen develops a revolutionary algorithm that bridges parallel universes, she doesn't expect to receive a message from herself—a version who made very different choices. As political tensions rise around her breakthrough, Amara must navigate ethical dilemmas and personal revelations while protecting her discovery from those who would weaponize it. Across dimensions, versions of herself are making choices that ripple through the multiverse, leading to an inevitable collision of realities.
